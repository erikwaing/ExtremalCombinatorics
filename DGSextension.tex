\section{Introduction}

Let $B_n$ denote the poset of all subsets of $[n]$, where $F_1 \leq F_2$ if $F_1 \subseteq F_2$ as sets. A 2-chain is any pair of sets $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that $F_1 \subset F_2$. Sperner's Theorem states that any family of $B_n$ with no 2-chains has at most $\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$, a bound that can be shown to be tight by considering all the subsets of $[n]$ with size $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$. Kleitman considered the related question of determining the minimum number of a 2-chains that must appear in a family of sets larger than $\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$. Das, Gan, and Sudakov considered this problem independently, and completely characterized all extremal families.

We analyze this problem for posets of the form $B_n / G$, where $G$ is subgroup of $S_n$.

\section{Groups Generated By a Transposition}

In this section, we restrict our attention to posets of the form $B_n / G$, where $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$ on $n$ elements generated by a single transposition. WLOG, let the transposition be $(12)$, and denote by $G_{(12)}$ the two-element group generated by that transposition

Let the $i$th level of $B_n$ consist of all subsets $F$ of size $i$. Then Sperner's Theorem states that no antichain in $B_n$ is larger than the largest level $P_i$ [Stanley]. [Stanley] shows how to extend the theorem to $B_n / G$ for all groups $G$. 

The $i$th level of $B_n / G_{(12)}$ has size $\binom{n-2}{i-2} + \binom{n-1}{i}$, where the first term in the sum counts the number of sets that include both 1 and 2, while the second term counts the sets where at most one element of $\{1,2\}$ is included. Because $B_n / G$ is rank-symmetric, the largest level has $\binom{n-2}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor -2} + \binom{n-1}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$ elements, which is also the size of the largest family containing no 2-chains [Stanley]

Theorem 1.2 of [Das] completely characterizes the minimum number of 2-chains in families $\F$ of subsets of $B_n$. We present a similar result for families $\F$ of subsets of $B_n / G$, where $G$ is a group generated by a transposition. However, first we prove a lemma.

Let $m = \binom{n-2}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor -2} + \binom{n-1}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$.

\begin{lemma} For any $s > m$, there exists a family $\F$ of $s$ elements of $B_n / G_{(12)}$ that minimizes the number of 2-chains and is such that if $A \in \F$ is of maximal cardinality, where we write $|A| = \frac{n}{2}+m$, then for any $B \subset A$ with $|B| \geq \frac{n}{2} - m + 1$, $B \in \F$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Suppose this is false. We can assume $m \geq 1$ since if $m = 0$ there cannot be a subset $B$. Let $l \leq 2m-1$ be the minimal integer such that there exists a maximal cardinality set $A$ with a corresponding subset $l$ levels below that is not in $\F$. We define
\begin{align*}
\A &= \{A \in F| \lvert a \rvert = \frac{n}{2}+m, \partial^l A \not\subset \F \}\\
\B &= \partial^l A - \F
\end{align*}
Construct a bipartite graph on $\A \cup \B$ with an edge $(A,B)$ iff $B \subset A$. Each edge corresponds to a pair of sets that make the lemma false.




%need to figure out the proper symbol so the absolute value doesn't look like the other vertical bar
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem} For any $s \geq m$, let $r \in \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{N}$ be the unique half-integer such that $\sum_{i = \frac{n}{2} - r +1}^{\frac{n}{2} + r -1} |P_i| < s \leq \sum_{i = \frac{n}{2}-r}^{\frac{n}{2}+r}|P_i|$. There exists a family of subsets $\F$ of $B_n / G_{(12)}$ where $|\F| = s$ that minimizes the number of 2-chains, and satisfies the following properties:

1) For every $A \in \F$, $n/2 - r \leq |A| \leq n/2 + r$

2) For any $A \in B_n / G_{(12)}$ with $n/2 - r + 1 \leq |A| \leq n/2 + r - 1$, we have $A \in \F$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove this with induction.
\end{proof}

\section{A Counterexample for a Different $G$}

This result does not extend to $B_n / G$ for any $G$. In particular, let $n = 6$ and let $G$ be the group generated by the transpositions $(12), (23),$ and $(34)$. An the following figure gives an example of a collection of 12 sets that is not taken by the middle levels and has less 2-chains than the collection of the 12 middle sets.
